# Revv Car Rental Website Clone

Revv Car Rental Website Clone was a **Unit-4 Construct Week Project** at Masai School. In this project, we built a clone of the **Revv car rental website** with core functionalities and a responsive design.  

Revv is a popular car rental service in India, offering self-drive cars for short and long durations. Our goal was to replicate essential features such as navigation, car listing, booking simulation, and user-friendly interface.
